# trapmusic_matlab

This library contains Matlab implementation of TRAP MUSIC multi-source localization algorithm. The library contains three functions
trapmusic_presetori.m
trapmusic_optori.m
trapmusic_example.m

The implementation is based on  
Makela, Stenroos, Sarvas, Ilmoniemi. Truncated RAP-MUSIC (TRAP-MUSIC) for MEG and EEG source localization. NeuroImage 167(2018):73--83.
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.11.013
For further information on the TRAP MUSIC approach, please see the publication. I also kindly ask you to cite the paper, if you use the approach and/or this implementation. If you do not have access to the paper, please send me a request by email.

I share the programs hoping that they would be useful for EEG/MEG data analysis, method development and learning. The programs are built and tested in Matlab R2019b, but they should work in any recent Matlab version. If not, please let me know.
